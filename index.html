        <h1>Vote for Keith Waxelman <br>for Minnetonka City Council</h1>

        <p class="tagline">
          I am a natural leader and find fulfillment through helping others and driving lasting impactful change. I have often thought about public service but until now had not seen the right opportunity.<br /> <br>
As a parent volunteer at a meeting for Tonka Cares with councilmember Patty Acomb, I learned about the open Ward 3 position. After discussing the scenario with Patty and meeting with our new mayor, Brad Wiersum, it became clear that running for the Minnetonka City Council would be a way to personally make a lasting positive impact upon the Minnetonka community I love.

          Keep Minnetonka Magnificent
        </h2>

      <p>
        Minnetonka was voted one of Money Magazine’s <a href="http://time.com/money/collection/best-places-to-live-2017/">100 Best Places to Live in America</a> for a reason. Minnetonka is a wonderful place to live, work, and play.
(On this list, Minnetonka came in at #85. I’d like to see us move up even higher.)
While I was not born and raised in Minnetonka, my family and I have fallen in love with Minnetonka and everything it has to offer. <br> <br> After moving here from Chicago several years ago during the “Polar Vortex,” we learned what a real winter feels like! Since then, our entire family has come to embrace Minnetonka- wonderful people, stunning scenery and outdoor activities, and great businesses.
Minnetonka is a fantastic city, and I would like to help keep Minnetonka magnificent, while preparing and improving it for the future. <br> <br>

              <h3>A Fresh Voice</h3>
              <p>Broad geographic experience helps give me a fresh perspective. While my family loves life up North in Minnetonka and call it “home,” in my past, I have lived in the East, the West, the Midwest, and Spain. I have also spent significant time in the Philippines, where my mother was born, and have traveled to over 20 countries. <br> <br>
        Through these various cultures, I have experienced that there are many different ways of life, each with their own strengths. There is not always only one way to examine or solve a problem. It is with that philosophy that I believe my experience can be of benefit to Minnetonka and its residents- to provide a fresh, fair, balanced approach to the challenges we face. </p>  <br>  <br>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <h3>A Fair & Balanced Approach that is <br>Pro-Minnetonka</h3>
              <p>Logic paired with empathy. Neither hard facts nor emotions tell the whole story. I believe in considering both for a fair, balanced approach for all citizens.</p>
              <h3>Fiscal Discipline</h3>
              <p>Taxpayers’ hard-earned money should be treated with great responsibility and care. Money spent by the city should be done with good fiscal diligence. Thankfully Minnetonka has a long history of fiscal responsibility, and I would like to continue that tradition.</p>  <br>

              <h3>Transparency</h3>
              <p>Public officials are elected to serve the citizens, and citizens deserve to know what is going on with their government.</p>  <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <h3>Quality of Life</h3>
              <p>Multigenerational Community- help ensure Minnetonka is an attractive place to live through all stages of life: young or old, with family or not <br> <br>
              As our population ages, we need to be sensitive to the needs of an aging population.  <br>  <br>
              At the same time, we should also keep the future in mind, as we ensure that we are attracting new residents who will help sustain our community and local businesses, while allowing them to thrive.</p>  <br>  <br>
              <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
              <p>The city of Minnetonka has been blessed with beautiful scenery and amazing natural resources for all of us to enjoy. Let’s keep it this way for future generations.</p>  <br>  <br>

              I have over twenty years’ experience in financial services, technology, and business strategy. My career has ranged from Fortune 10 companies to startups, so I have an understanding of organizations across a wide spectrum. With my wide range of experience and my fresh perspectives, I believe that I would be able to make a positive impact on our community. <br>  <br>
              My passion lies in technology and supporting entrepreneurs. Since moving to Minneapolis, I have been working to help build the greater Twin Cities entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure we are doing what we can to foster the next great companies of tomorrow.  <br>
